There are a few ways to set up a GraphQL API in Node.js. These options may include: 

Apollo Server
Hasura
Prisma
PostGraphile
Alternatively, you can build your own server with custom resolvers and a schema definition. While there are pros and cons for each method, we’ll use PostGraphile in this tutorial. We’ve made that choice because it provides an instant GraphQL API based on the DB schema.
